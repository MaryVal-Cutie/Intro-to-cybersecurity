### Lecture Notes
> From the course notes reviewed in class, take note on the material from this lesson as it relates to the Lesson Objectives and Guiding Question(s):
  About Sandboxing- optimizes use of expensive hardwares  such as servers. 

About  Virtualization software machines examples: VMWare Workstation ( windows)  Microsoft Microsoft HyperV, VMWare Fusin (Mac) and oracle  Virtual Box. 

A virtual machine is just like a physical PC in that is has dedicated resources  like Memory (RAM), Ethernet Connection (NIC) and Storage  (Hard  Disks )

Optimally the host OS will have 8GB of RAM minimum and each Win guest 4GB min or Linux guest 2GB min.

Community colleges and regional cyber ranges across the US provide online access to virtual machines and labs. These VMs are usually connected into virtual  Local Area Networks (LAN) like the one in this image.

 Virtualization- is technology used to allow a computer to have more than one Operating System (OS) present and operating at the same time on a single piece of hardware.  

 Hypervisor- is an iterface between a virtual machine ( VM )  and the host machine hardware. Hypervidors are the layer that enables virtualization.

 Sandboxing- is the seperation between software and  hardware  that creates a barrier to improve security.

Host- your physical computer

Host OS- the operating system running on your physical computer

Guest machine OS- the virtual computer with OS running inside a virtualization software.

Virtualization software- the sandbox software that provides an engine for guest virtual machines
