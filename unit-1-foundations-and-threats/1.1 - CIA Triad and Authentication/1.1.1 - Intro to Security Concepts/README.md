### Lecture Notes
> From the course notes reviewed in class, take note on the material from this lesson as it relates to the Lesson Objectives and Guiding Question(s):
Notes: Model of Computer Security- Protection=Prevention +(Detection +Response)
Protection- What the goal is. 
Prevention- What you can do ahead of time.
Detection-what you can do while the system is running to determine iif something is wrong.
Response- When something wrong is detected what you can do to fix the problem.
The CIA Triad- Integrity, confidentiality and Availability.
CIA stands for Confidentiality, Integrity and Availability. Data is not revealed and Data is intact- not modified or corrupted. Data is accessible to allowed users.
Confidentiality Protection- against unauthorized access
Integrity Protection- against unauthorized modification
Availability Protection- against denial of service 

Data states- Data at Rest, Data in Transit and Data in Use 

Data at Rest- storage information

Data in Transit- transmission

Data in Use- processing file.

Loss of Confidentiality- stolen data that was made public. NSA leaks of government data by Edward Snowden. 

Loss of Integrity- data was corrupted. STUXNET worm- changed the code on the centrifuge machines in an Iranian nuclear.

Loss of Availability- data is inaccessible, a common reason is a DDos attack= Distributed Denial of Service.
