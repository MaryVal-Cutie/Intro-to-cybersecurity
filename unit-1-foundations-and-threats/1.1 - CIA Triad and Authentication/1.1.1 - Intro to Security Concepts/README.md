# 1.1.1 Intro to Security Concepts

## Lesson Objective(s):
- Identify the key goals and frameworks of Cybersecurity
- Identify the CIA triad as the characteristics of information
- Identify the state of information as stored, transmission, and processing

## Guiding Question(s):
- How does the protection of the CIA triad lead to the security of data?
Protecting the CIA triad is like keeping your stuff safe in real life. Confidentiality is like keeping your diary or phone password-protected so only you can see it. Integrity is making sure nobody messes with your homework or game scores. Availability is like making sure your favorite app or game actually works when you want to use it, thats all.

### Lecture Notes
> From the course notes reviewed in class, take note on the material from this lesson as it relates to the Lesson Objectives and Guiding Question(s):
Notes:
 Model of Computer Security- Protection=Prevention +(Detection +Response)

Protection- What the goal is. 

Prevention- What you can do ahead of time.

Detection-what you can do while the system is running to determine iif something is wrong.
Response- When something wrong is detected what you can do to fix the problem.

 Data is not revealed and Data is intact- not modified or corrupted. Data is accessible to allowed users.

 Data states- Data at Rest, Data in Transit and Data in Use 

Data at Rest- storage information like USB drives, hard drives, memory and DVD's

Data in Transit- transmission like being moved from one system to another sharing on a LAN or transfer on the Internet.

Data in Use- processing file creation by user, data used in an application. Being processed or placed in memory.

Loss of Confidentiality- stolen data that was made public. NSA leaks of government data by Edward Snowden. 

Loss of Integrity- data was corrupted. STUXNET worm- changed the code on the centrifuge machines in an Iranian nuclear.

Loss of Availability- data is inaccessible, a common reason is a DDos attack= Distributed Denial of Service. Hackers infected more than 145,000 internet- attached devices like camera and ordered them to flood Krebs website with traffic.

Response- When something wrong is detected what you can do to fix the problem. 

Confidentiality- Data is not revealed Example: Were going to release the game on the 17th. Oh they are releasing on the 17th let me tell the newspaper.

Integrity- Data is intact- not modified or corrupted Example: Were going to release the game on the 17th, let me change that to the 21st, were going to release the game on the 17th.

Availability- Data is accesible for other users. Example: were going to release the game on the 17th. Other person ....xxxx.

### Application / Personal Research / Summary
> In your own words, write a summary of this lesson and connect it to yourself and the real-world. If needbe, do a rapid research on the topic to help with you summary
  Cybersecurity is all about keeping computers, apps, and information safe from people who want to steal, break, or misuse it. There are lots of different careers, like being a security analyst, ethical hacker, or digital detective, and they all help protect important information in the real world.Lastly about protecting datas and the CIA Triad Confidentiality, Integrity and Availability.

### Vocabulary
> Include the vocabulary word(s) from this lesson with a defintion
The CIA Triad- Integrity, confidentiality and Availability.

CIA stands for Confidentiality, Integrity and Availability.

Confidentiality Protection- against unauthorized access

Integrity Protection- against unauthorized modification

Availability Protection- against denial of service
